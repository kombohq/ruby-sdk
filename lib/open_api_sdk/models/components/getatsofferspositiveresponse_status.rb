      # GetAtsOffersPositiveResponseStatus - The offer’s current status. The usual flow of statuses is as follows:
      # `DRAFT` -> `APPROVED` -> `SENT` -> `ACCEPTED` or `DECLINED`.
      # 
      # Please note that not all systems will expose all statuses. For example, most systems do not include the `APPROVED` status
      # 
      # - `ACCEPTED`: The offer was accepted by the candidate.
      # - `DECLINED`: The offer was declined by the candidate.
      # - `SENT`: The offer was sent to the candidate.
      # - `APPROVED`: The draft was approved.
      # - `DRAFT`: The offer is a draft and has not yet been sent to the candidate.
      # - `ABANDONED`: The offer has expired or is no longer valid and should not be considered.
